## Data Collection
To understand the Africa Rising narrative in different parts of the world and see the differences between print and social media, we developed two separate corpora. One corpus included all of the tweets including #AfricaRising from January 1, 2011 to April 13, 2018. The Twitter corpus was developed using Pytheas. With Twitter, we knew that couldn’t go all the way back to the start of the Africa rising narrative but we wanted to get a clear picture of what Africa rising means in the digital space. After build the corpus, we extracted the top 100 hashtags in the tweets. We then used network mapping in Cortext to produce a network map of the tweets and demographic analysis to chart its evolution over time. 

We developed the corpus of newspaper articles mentioning Ghana and Kenya using Factiva. As we did not trust online translation tools, we focused on English-language newspapers or already translated papers. Also, given the irrelevance of sports to the Africa Rising narrative, we decided to exclude articles on sports from our Factiva searches. We downloaded articles from either 1998 to the start of this year or from when Factiva began subscribing to the newspaper until the start of this year. While this does not give us a consistent time frame for the articles, our analysis is more focused on the holistic narrative and regional differences, so we accepted this tradeoff. 

We chose to focus on Ghana and Kenya to develop these corpora for several reasons:
they are English-speaking countries and Cortext works best with English-language sources
they are closely linked with the Africa rising narrative
Kenya and Ghana are two are of the large FDI recipients in Africa
Picking two countries allowed us to balance collecting a feasible number of articles and producing generalizable results. 
We decided to exclude Nigeria. Due to its size and the number of articles on it, Nigeria would have dominated the corpora and we wanted to compare two comparable countries.

When we selected our newspapers, we aimed to pick a geographically diverse group of major newspapers with large readerships. We also wanted to ensure our list included African sources, newspapers from major FDI source countries, and newspapers from non-major FDI source countries.
